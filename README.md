<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The React Task App was created with the intention of being an easy and efficient way to organize tasks and reminders. This project was made to be a replica of the React-Task Tracker App from the Traversy Media YouTube channel. Its main features are:

- add or delete tasks or reminders with description and date;

- add a "remind me" option (the same can be applied by double clicking on the reminder);</p>
